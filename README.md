# Go Socket
This package implements a very basic version of a net socket via Golang.
It's possible to start a UNIX/TCP socket via this package, with some built in features.

Everyone that connects to this socket get's a uuid.
It's possible to receive messages per client and respond to them via a basic HTTP-like interface.
It's also possible to broadcast a message to all clients.

Feel free to dig into this package and find out how it works.
Some more details will be added later (probably).
